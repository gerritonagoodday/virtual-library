# virtual-library
The Virtual Library component for Joomla lets you create, maintain and host a Virtual Library of ebooks, reference web sites and real printed books and other types of publications. You can upload and delete ebooks and categorise your collection of ebooks so that browsing your collection is more enjoyable. You can sort them using various criteria, and ultimately, you can peruse, read and enjoy them.



>This Joomla component runs a Virtual
Library that attempts to simulate a real
library, but without the musty smell and
the officious librarian in horn-rimmed
lasses and beehive hairstyle who goes
Shhhhhhhhhhhhh! to hapless patrons at
the slightest acoustic infraction. With
this you can create, maintain and host a
Virtual Library of ebooks, reference web
sites and real printed books and other
types of publications. You can upload
and delete ebooks, categorise your
collection of ebooks so that browsing
your collection is more enjoyable. You
can sort them using various criteria,
and ultimately, you can peruse, read and
enjoy them. And you don't need to put
them back again in the right place when
you have finished looking at them.
